Replaces placeholders in documents (navbar, ...) with HTML "components", for cases where really simple and efficient websites are desired without using any JS frameworks (client-side assembly) or other complex build steps (with bloated dependency trees etc).

WARNING: If you're a modern web developer, this project might hurt your personal feelings. Investigate and use at your own risk.
